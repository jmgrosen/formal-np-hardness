\section{Introduction}

Throughout this course, we have been doing various proofs of NP-hardness, or of
PSPACE-hardness, or hardness with respect to some other class. All of these
proofs, though, have been on whiteboards, in conversation, on Coauthor, or on
``pen and paper'' -- that is, they are \emph{informal} proofs. This is not say
they are proof sketches -- the point is that they contain enough detail for a
human to verify with reasonable confidence. However, informal proofs have their
faults -- for example, it has been mentioned a couple times that a result stated
in the lecture videos actually had a bug in the proof, usually small and easily
fixable, but not always.

For this reason (...along with our own personal interests...), we have been
thinking about writing proofs of complexity results \emph{formally} -- that is,
proofs written in a formal system that can be verified by a computer. This can
provide greater guarantees that a proof is correct, at the expense of a lot more
work writing the proof.

The goal of this project, then, is to write a library in Coq for proving that
certain problems are NP-hard, and then prove some problems to be NP-hard. We
suppose this is closest to an ``implementation'' type of project.

\section{Related Work}

To our surprise, we were not able to find any existing work on formal proofs of
complexity results. Thus, there are three main categories of related works:
informal complexity proofs, formal proofs of correctness, and formal proofs of
polytimeness.

For the first category, given our initially simple goals, we focus primarily on
the two fundamental works of NP-hardness. In 1971, Cook proved that CNF-SAT (and
thus SAT) is NP-hard~\cite{cook1971}. The next year, Karp built on Cook's work
to demonstrate the NP-hardness of a smattering of classic
problems~\cite{karp1972}.

The idea of formally proving mathematical theorems has been in vogue for a while
now, with a few famous results, such as a formal proof of the four color
theorem~\cite{gonthier2008}. We use the proof assistant Coq for our
formalization~\cite{coq2019}.

We see four primary approaches to formally proving polytimeness:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a language that limits you to explicitly the polytime functions.
  Apparently Bellantoni and Cook gave a \emph{fully syntactic} characterization
  of polytime functions~\cite{recursion92} -- super cool! In particular, it has
  soundness (every syntactically valid program executes in polytime) and
  \emph{extensional} completeness (for every function problem which can be
  solved in polytime, there exists a syntactically valid program that computes
  that function). Heraud and Nowak formalized it in Coq~\cite{formalization11}.
  However, it's apparently extremely hard to write actual programs in -- and, we
  imagine, verify programs in. So probably not what we're looking for.

\item In the same vein, there's restrictions on term rewriting systems that
  gives you polytime-ness. In particular, there's one that uses
  "quasi-interpretations"~\cite{quasi11}, as formalized in Coq by some of the
  same folks as before~\cite{formal18}. This seems a good bit nicer, though
  still not terribly easy to use -- they proved the polytime-ness and
  correctness of binary addition in about ~300 fairly simple-looking lines of
  Coq, and of modular exponentiation in about ~1000 lines. However, this (from
  the formalization paper) scares me: "Indeed, there may be a program prog1
  [...] with a QI interpretation, but which can’t be extended with a program
  prog2 defined on top of it [...] such that a QI can be found, in which case
  prog1, or at least its QI, has to be modified." Given that a lot of reductions
  reduce most easily from problems other than SAT known to be NP-hard, we want
  some sort of transitivity -- e.g., if we know there's a reduction from SAT to
  3SAT and a reduction from 3SAT to problem A, we know there's a reduction from
  SAT to problem A. However, this warning of non-compositionality makes me worry
  that such a property might be impossible to prove.

\item There are operational semantics for use with deeply embedded languages
  which instrument execution with a time cost. These have the unfortunate
  downside (as best we can tell) that they don't have any direct connection to
  running time on Turing machines, unlike the previous approaches, which are
  proven (at least on paper) to be equivalent to the class of polytime function
  problems. There seem to be three approaches to using these: directly, with
  some sort of Hoare logic, or with a type system. For small examples, maybe
  just directly inverting a bigstep relation might work. But for larger
  programs, some people have used Hoare logics; the example of this that we're
  aware of is by Charguéraud and Pottier, who used a separation logic with time
  credits to prove amortized complexity of some ML programs~\cite{machine15}.
  The proofs look pretty nasty though. The alternate approach is through the
  type system; the example we know of here is TiML~\cite{timl17}, a project from
  a former student in our lab, which is much much nicer to use, but currently
  isn't really set up to do proofs about the programs in Coq. However, it's
  worth noting that with both of these, the goal is typically to prove some time
  bound much finer-grained than just polytime.

\item Finally, there are axiomatic cost models of shallowly-embedded languages
  in coq, such as the model included as part of the Foundational Cryptography
  Framework~\cite{fcf15}. These have the least connection to the underlying
  complexity theory, but tend to be the easiest to use, and have been used to
  model polynomially-bounded adversaries in formal cryptographic settings. They
  allow the use of normal Coq definitions, meaning they are easy to reason about
  using the built-in tools of Coq.
\end{enumerate}

Although the first two options are perhaps the most theoretically sound, we
intend to go with either option 3 or 4, considering the limited time available
for a class project.

\section{Milestones}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Get a reasonable definition of NP-hard written down, based on the approach
  described above.
\item Prove 3-SAT to be NP-hard.
\item Prove some puzzle to be NP-hard from 3-SAT.
\item lily help me out here
\end{enumerate}

If we manage to do all that, we could prove NP-hardness of more classic
problems, or could prove PSPACE-hardness of some problems (since our technique
is easily modifiable to this -- just swap out SAT for QSAT).

\section{Authors}

This is intended to be John's \emph{main} (and only) project. Lily is planning
to make \emph{minor} contributions.
